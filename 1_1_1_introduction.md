### Transcript

Welcome to the first section of *Make Your Own App*, HTML newbie!

Laying the foundation for developing apps is quite simple: Start coding! But how, you ask? Well, if you've got a basic idea of your app, it's easy to set up the fundamental structure. Doing this right from the beginning will massively help you when you continue developing your app later on, because outdated parts of the app can be replaced by more sophisticated ones in a jiffy.

In this section you'll learn the necessary tools to build such a basic structure. For this, you need to know how to write certain HTML elements and how to structure your HTML. Furthermore you will learn how to fill your app with a bit of content: Headings and paragraphs.

After you get the gist of things, you will move on to actually structuring your app.

While structuring your app is essential for your progress later on, in order to be able to work with your code even after some time or in groups, you'll need to learn to structure your code as well. To prevent you from producing spaghetti-code, a style of code so messy, looking at it is like trying to determine the trajectory of a single spaghetti noodle in a bowl of pasta – we like to refer to this as "spajectory", hehe – , we will also teach you one of the most vital parts of coding: Indentation and comments.

But enough with all this chatter, you now know enough about the essentials to get crackin', so whacha waitin' fo?

Next time we will show you how to style your app by using some – of course fancy – effects. So see you next time/in a bit, HTML newbie!
