Elements are everything in HTML. Every website or web app consists mainly of elements that are interpreted and displayed by the browser (sometimes differently, due to the different browsers that exist). For this reason, it is essential to learn how to write elements in HTML. Fortunately, this is quite easy.

An element consists of **three main parts**. The first part of the element is the **start tag** `<...>`. After the start tag follows the **content** of the element. In the end the element is declared finished by the **end tag**: `</...>`. The type of element is defined by the **tag name** used for both the start and end tag.

```html
<tagname> content </tagname>
```

Take a minute to look at the structure of an HTML element. Understanding this basic topic and the notation is crucial for the upcoming tasks and units.
