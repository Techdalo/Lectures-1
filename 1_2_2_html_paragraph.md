title: HTML Element - Paragraph
layout: page
---

You already know how to write elements in HTML. The most often used, basic, and rudimentary element is the paragraph element. The tag name to declare a paragraph element is `p`. The whole paragraph element would be written as `<p></p>` in a corresponding editor.

```html
<p> Some content </p>
```

Paragraph elements are often used for descriptions and content of websites and web apps. A good example for this is Wikipedia. You may open a random subject in Wikipedia and view the source code of the displayed site in your browser by right clicking and choosing the corresponding entry or by pressing **ctrl + u (or cmd + u on mac)**. To find the paragraph elements in the source code you may need to scroll down.

In the code editor below you see an already coded HTML paragraph element. Click the play-button to see the result.

### Task

Let's get active and try something easy ourselves: Imagine you have a part of a weather app that tells you the expected weather for tomorrow. But the sentence describing the weather for tomorrow is outdated. "Thereâ€™s not a cloud in the sky" the next day. Make sure the paragraph shows the correct content.
