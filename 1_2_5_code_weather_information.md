The weather forecast already includes the weather for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. But it should also display the weather of the remaining weekdays. You think that some people may use their smartphone to look up the forecasted weather and that's why you decide to create an extra page for the missing four days. Create this new page with the following content:

- A first level headline, with the content: FORECAST
- For each missing weekday as specified above, a second level headline with its name as content
- Add a paragraph below each weekday with some textual content describing the weather
