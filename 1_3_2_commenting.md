Writing a lot of code without documenting what you had in mind while doing it can become a big problem later on. Especially if the code becomes more complex and abstract, colleagues will have difficulties to review and add to your work.

Comments are used to address this problem. You can write **explanations and descriptions** of your code above the actual code and they will not be interpreted as code by the computer. Comments are always indicated by a predefined sequence of characters, which is specific for every programming language. Comments in HTML can be written as follows:

```html
<!--This is a comment-->
```

Comments are **only visible in the HTML code and not in the rendered page**.

The example is very basic and doesn't make much sense at this point. But when the code becomes more sophisticated, you'll want to include comments to remind you what different code segments are about and what you intended to do. This seems tedious at first but it'll prove worthwhile, especially when reviewing your code after some time or when sharing it with others.

### Task

Add a random comment above each day to practice the syntax.
