To write HTML code offline, you need an editor and a browser like Chrome or Firefox to display the website. There are various editors you can choose from. Even the most basic text editors like Windows Editor can serve as a code editor. However, we recommend to use a dedicated code editor as it has several advantages such as code highlighting and auto code completion.

For this course we recommend:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} for code editing and
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"} as a browser.

This is a matter of preference and you're invited to share your opinion in the discussion board. Other editors like Atom work fine as well. We like VSCode and use it in our screencasts. The editor has certain build-in functionalities that we'll explain later on.
